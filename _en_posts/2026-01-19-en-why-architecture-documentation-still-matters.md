As artificial intelligence becomes embedded in more systems, a familiar idea starts to surface: if AI can reason, explain, and even generate code, do we still need to document architecture?

The temptation is understandable. Documentation has never enjoyed a good reputation. It is often seen as a burden—something that gets postponed, becomes outdated, or exists only to satisfy a formal requirement. In an environment where systems evolve quickly and AI promises on-demand answers, it can seem reasonable to think that architecture documentation is less urgent.

In practice, the opposite is true.

AI accelerates development, but it also accelerates the loss of context. Decisions are made faster, systems change more frequently, and layers of abstraction multiply. Without an explicit way to capture why a system is the way it is, knowledge dissolves into conversations, prompts, tickets, or scattered repositories.

Architectural documentation does not exist to describe the system as it appears from the outside. It exists to preserve the reasoning behind it. To record which problems were being addressed, which alternatives were discarded, and which trade-offs were consciously accepted.

This becomes especially critical when AI components are involved. Models, data, and decision mechanisms introduce behaviors that are not always obvious by observing the system in operation. Without context, past decisions are easily misinterpreted, and mistakes that were already identified tend to be repeated.

Another common effect of AI is a sense of constant fluidity. Everything seems adjustable, reversible, easy to tweak. But that apparent flexibility can hide structural fragility. When no one remembers why certain boundaries, dependencies, or constraints exist, even a “small” change can have disproportionate consequences.

Documenting architecture does not mean producing long documents or perfect diagrams. It means capturing what truly matters: the decisions that shape the system’s evolution. The non-obvious ones. The ones that, if lost, force teams to rediscover the system through trial and error.

Documentation also plays a quieter but equally important role: aligning people. In complex systems, different teams often hold different mental models of how the platform actually works. Architectural documentation provides a shared reference point, even—and especially—when it is not fully up to date.

In AI-driven contexts, that alignment becomes even more important. The boundaries between what a system decides, what a model suggests, and what a human validates must be explicit. When they are not, incorrect expectations emerge, responsibilities blur, and trust in the system erodes over time.

Paradoxically, the presence of AI makes documentation more valuable, not less. Not because AI cannot help explain a system, but because it needs a clear foundation to do so. Without structure and explicit decisions, AI can only improvise on ambiguous ground.

Architectural documentation is not a relic of the past. It is a tool that keeps systems understandable as they grow more complex. It does not prevent change, but it makes change safer. It does not eliminate uncertainty, but it constrains it.

AI can help you build faster.  
Architecture documentation helps you build with intent.
