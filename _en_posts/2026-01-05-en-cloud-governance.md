## Context

When cloud governance is mentioned, many organisations think of bureaucracy:  
committees, approvals and heavy processes.

For small teams, that usually means one thing:  
blockage.

But the absence of governance does not create agility.  
It creates chaos.

---

## The real problem

I have seen small teams move in just a few months from  
“we are fast”  
to  
“we have no idea what is deployed or how much it costs”.

The same problems keep appearing:

- Resources with no owner  
- Unexpected bills  
- Environments that cannot be reproduced  
- Security based on assumptions  

The common mistake is to think that governance is something you add when problems appear.

In the cloud, by the time problems appear,  
it is already too late.

## The criterion

Cloud governance is not centralised control.  
It is **autonomy with clear boundaries**.

A good governance model for small teams defines from day one:

- What can be created  
- Where  
- With which naming conventions  
- With which tags  
- With which cost limits  

That does not slow teams down.  
It prevents them from having to fight fires later.

## Practical implications

In practice, a lightweight but effective model usually includes:

- Naming conventions  
- Mandatory tags (team, environment, cost)  
- Spending limits per project  
- Basic security policies  
- Deployment templates  

All automated.

It is not about asking for permission.  
It is about not breaking the system without realising it.

---

## The key idea

Real agility is not doing anything you want.  
It is being able to change fast **without losing control**.

Good cloud governance does not slow teams down.  
It allows them to run without falling.
