## Context

When people think about software architecture, they often imagine diagrams: boxes, arrows and colours.

They are useful. But they are not architecture.

---

## The real problem

I have seen projects with beautiful diagrams and systems that nobody truly understood.

The reason is simple:  
diagrams show **what exists**, but not **why it exists**.

When problems appear, diagrams do not help you decide.

---

## The criterion

Architecture is the set of **hard decisions** that shape everything else.

- What is decoupled  
- What is centralised  
- What is automated  
- What is kept manual  

A good architect does not draw more. They decide better.

## Practical implications

When an organisation treats architecture as drawing:

- It debates form  
- Not substance  
- It wastes time  
- It builds fragile systems  

When it treats architecture as decisions:

- Teams align  
- Errors are reduced  
- Change accelerates  

---

## The key idea

Diagrams explain systems.  
Decisions create systems.

That is architecture.
