## Context

In many projects people talk about “producing a DSA” as if it were just another formality.  
A document that has to be delivered, signed and archived.

The result is usually predictable:  
a set of diagrams, some generic text,  
and very little real value once development starts.

The problem is not the DSA.  
The problem is **why it is created and how it is used**.

---

## The real problem

In practice, many DSAs fail for the same reasons:

- They focus on **describing** the solution instead of justifying it  
- They document the *what*, but not the *why*  
- They are written at the end, when decisions are already locked in  
- They are never consulted again  

So the DSA becomes:

- A contractual artefact  
- A compliance document  
- A PDF that no one ever opens again  

And when problems appear in production, the DSA is useless,  
because it **does not explain the decisions** that led there.

---

## The criterion

A properly understood DSA is not a catalogue of diagrams.  
It is a **structured record of architectural decisions**.

Its main purpose is not to explain the system,  
but to answer questions such as:

- Why was this architecture chosen instead of another?
- What alternatives were considered and rejected?
- What trade-offs were consciously accepted?
- What assumptions were made at the time?

A good DSA acts as a **shared contract of understanding**  
between business, technology and operations.

It does not prevent change.  
It prevents change without memory.

---

## Practical implications

In real projects, a useful DSA usually has these characteristics:

- It is **iterative**, not a frozen document  
- It evolves with the system  
- It references explicit decisions (ADRs)  
- It prioritises clarity over exhaustiveness  

It does not need:

- Dozens of diagrams  
- Reused generic text  
- Unnecessary jargon  

It needs:

- Context  
- Decisions  
- Consequences  

A DSA that is not consulted when something fails  
is not fulfilling its purpose.

## The key idea

A DSA is not a document to justify the past.  
It is a tool to **understand the present and make better decisions for the future**.

When used well, it reduces friction, accelerates decisions  
and avoids circular debates.

When used badly, it is just another forgotten PDF.

The difference is not in the template.  
It is in the judgement.
