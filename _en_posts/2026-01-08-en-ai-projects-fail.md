## Context

Most organisations have already run at least one AI pilot.  
Chatbots, search engines, document analysis, text generation.

Many of them work.  
For a few weeks.

Then the problems start.

---

## The real problem

AI projects rarely fail because of the model.  
They fail because of:

- Low-quality data  
- Missing processes  
- Lack of governance  
- Lack of ownership  
- Uncontrolled costs  

In a pilot, all of this is ignored.  
In production, all of it blows up.

---

## The criterion

AI is not a technology project.  
It is an **operational change**.

It introduces new flows:

- Data that keeps changing  
- Models that degrade  
- Variable costs  
- New risks  

If the organisation does not adapt to this,  
the system becomes unstable.

---

## Practical implications

For an AI project to scale, it must exist from the very beginning:

- Data owners  
- Validation processes  
- Quality metrics  
- Clear budgets  
- Control mechanisms  

Without these, the pilot only creates expectations.

---

## The key idea

AI pilots are easy.  
What is hard is **operating them as living systems**.

That is where demos are separated from products.
