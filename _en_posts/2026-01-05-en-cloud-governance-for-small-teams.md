When people talk about cloud governance, many organisations think of bureaucracy: committees, approvals and heavy processes. For small teams, that usually means one thing: blockage.

And yet, the absence of governance does not create agility. It creates chaos.

I have seen small teams move in a few months from “we are fast” to “we don’t know what we have deployed or how much it costs”. Resources without owners, unexpected bills, environments that cannot be reproduced, and security based on assumptions start to appear. The pattern is always the same: governance was treated as something that could be added later.

In cloud, when the problems show up, it is already too late.

Cloud governance is not centralised control. It is **autonomy with clear boundaries**. A good model for small teams defines from the beginning what can be created, where, with which names, with which tags and with which cost limits. That does not slow people down; it prevents them from constantly fighting fires.

The difference is subtle but fundamental. It is not about asking for permission, but about designing a space where the right things happen by default and the wrong ones are hard to do.

In practice, a lightweight but effective model usually includes naming conventions, mandatory tags (team, environment, cost), spending limits per project, basic security policies and deployment templates. All automated. Not as an extra process, but as part of the system itself.

When this exists, teams can move fast without losing control. When it does not, every small change adds operational and financial debt that someone will have to pay later.

Real agility is not being able to do anything. It is being able to change fast **without breaking the system**.

Good cloud governance does not slow teams down. It lets them run without falling.
