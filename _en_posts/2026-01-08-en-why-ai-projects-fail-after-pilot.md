Most organisations have already run some kind of AI pilot. Chatbots, search tools, document analysis, text generation. Many of them work. For a few weeks.

Then the problems start.

AI projects rarely fail because of the model. They fail because of data, processes, lack of governance, unclear ownership and costs that nobody is really controlling. In a pilot, all of that can be ignored. In production, it all blows up.

AI is not just a technology project. It is an **operational change**. It introduces new flows: data that keeps changing, models that degrade, variable costs and risks that did not exist before. If the organisation does not adapt to those flows, the system becomes unstable by definition.

That is why so many promising pilots never go any further. They work in an artificial environment, with frozen data, limited users and costs that do not yet matter. As soon as they touch the real world —real users, changing data and finite budgets— the cracks appear.

For an AI project to scale, more than a working model must exist from day one. There must be clear data ownership, validation processes, quality metrics, defined budgets and control mechanisms. Not as extra bureaucracy, but as part of the system itself.

Without that, a pilot only creates expectations. And unmet expectations quickly turn into mistrust.

That is why AI pilots are easy. What is hard is **operating them as living systems** that change, degrade and need to be governed. That is where demos turn into products — or fail to.
