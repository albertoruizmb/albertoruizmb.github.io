## Context

Most organisations want to “use AI”.  
Very few really understand what that means.

They think in terms of tools.  
Chatbots.  
Automation.

But AI is not just another tool.  
It is a structural change.

---

## The real problem

AI introduces new frictions:

- It changes how decisions are made  
- It changes how data is used  
- It changes who holds operational power  
- It changes risk  

When this is introduced without a clear framework,  
the organisation starts to fragment.

---

## The criterion

Introducing AI is not about installing technology.  
It is about redesigning processes.

It requires:

- Clear data ownership  
- Accountability for outputs  
- Cost control  
- Oversight mechanisms  

Without these, AI creates more noise than value.

---

## Practical implications

Healthy AI adoption usually starts with:

- Well-defined use cases  
- Clear metrics  
- Accountable teams  
- Shared platforms  

Not with massive rollouts.

---

## The key idea

AI can accelerate an organisation.  
Or it can break it.

The difference is not in the model.  
It is in the design of the system around it.
