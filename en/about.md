## About

I am a software engineer and solutions architect. I work at the intersection of  
**technology strategy** and **execution**: turning business needs into architecture,  
teams and deliverables that actually work.

Typical areas:

- Cloud architecture (Azure) and governance  
- AI applied to products (RAG, agents, search, evaluation)  
- Software engineering and standardisation (ALM, CI/CD, quality)  

This blog is a place to share **technical judgement** through practical examples.
